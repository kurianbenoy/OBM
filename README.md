Workflow
========

If you are interested in participating in these sprints, define your
long-term and short-term goals, and ping "mbuf" on irc.freenode.net.

The short-term goals are further sub-divided into tasks which are
aligned to sprints.

The tasks can be any one of the following categories: READ, WRITE,
DEV, OPS, MEETING.

For each sprint, you decide on the hours you can spend per day, and
the list of tasks.

During the sprint, you can send PR with clocked time if you are
already familiar with Emacs and Org mode. Otherwise, you can send your
clocked times in the following format to "mbuf", and also mention the
status of the task (IN_PROGRESS, DONE):

    CLOCK: [2018-02-21 Wed 14:45]--[2018-02-21 Wed 15:00]

At the end of a sprint, a retrospection meeting will be held to review
the same.

It is recommended for participants to wear a heavy watch so that they
have the notion of time.
